'''
The KMP matching algorithm uses degenerating property (pattern having same
sub-patterns appearing more than once in the pattern) of the pattern and
improves the worst case complexity to O(n). The basic idea behind KMPâ€™s
algorithm is: whenever we detect a mismatch (after some matches), we already
know some of the characters in the text of the next window. We take advantage
of this information to avoid matching the characters that we know will anyway match.
